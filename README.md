## Biography
I'm currently a third-year PhD student in [IIOT Research Center](http://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Professor [Xiaoying Gan](https://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/#/xygan) and Professor [Xinbing Wang](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/). I received bachelor from Shanghai Jiao Tong University with honors in July 2020 and was recommended for the master degree from Sepetember 2020. Additionally, I transfer to be a PhD student (硕博连读) in March, 2022. My research fields now are graph mining, few-shot learning, spatial-temporal data mining.

欢迎对图神经网络、城市计算、知识迁移等方向感兴趣的交大PRP/大创/暑期实习/毕业设计同学与我取得联系。希望同学熟悉Python等编程语言，对深度学习基本算法与代码框架有所了解更佳，勤奋认真，学有余力，对学术研究有热情！

## Project

**DDE DataExpo -- Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE) Program** The [Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE) Program](https://www.ddeworld.org/) is the first 'big science program' initiated by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) that will provide new opportunities and directions for the development of Earth Sciences. DDE DataStore is an important component of Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE) Program, aiming to discover and integrate global geological data. At present, DDE DataExpo has obtained more than 1 million websites based on 15,000 keywords and found more than 200,000 geological data.[\[website\]](https://dataexpo.deep-time.org/#/)[\[poster\]](https://github.com/RobinLu1209/robinlu1209.github.io/blob/master/files/datastore-poster.pdf)
