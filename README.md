## Biography
I'm currently a PhD student in [IIOT Research Center](http://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Professor [Xiaoying Gan](https://iwct.sjtu.edu.cn/Personal/xygan/) and Professor [Xinbing Wang](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/). I received bachelor from Shanghai Jiao Tong University with honors in July 2020 and was recommended for the master degree from Sepetember 2020. Additionally, I transfer to be a PhD student (硕博连读) in March, 2022. My research fields now are graph mining, few-shot learning, spatial-temporal data mining.

## Project

**DDE DataStore -- Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE) Program** The [Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE) Program](https://www.ddeworld.org/) is the first 'big science program' initiated by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) that will provide new opportunities and directions for the development of Earth Sciences. DDE DataStore is an important component of Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE) Program, aiming to discover and integrate global geological data. At present, DDE DataStore has obtained more than 1 million websites based on 15,000 keywords and found more than 10,000 geological data.[\[website\]](https://datastore.acemap.info/#/)
